		<h2>Travels ✈️</h2>
		<p>I like travelling. I am a curious person so it's important for me to discover the world and some others cultures. I have already visited a lot of European countries like Greece, Italy, the Czech Republic or the Netherlands. Recently I did an university exchange in Canada so i could discover North America. Here are some pictures to make you travel a little before we can do it again! 📷</p>

		<h2>Reading 📚</h2>
		<p>I love reading. I read every night before I fall asleep. My favorite books are detective novels but not long ago I read a book that really inspired me: it was Michelle Obama's autobiography. If you are looking for a book to read I really recommend it!!</p>
